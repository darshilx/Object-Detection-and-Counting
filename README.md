# Object-Detection-and-Counting
To count the number of cement bags passed in front of a camera on a conveyor belt


There are 2 Approaches that we followed for this project:

1) Tensorflow and dlib(Machine Learning): This approach is less accutrate than the second one.
   To run the program follow the commands specified in commands.txt file. We have to provide the paths for following:
   a) Pre-Trained Model
   b) Labelmap file
   c) Video file on which to perform the detection
   
 2) Pixel Value Sensing:
   This approach works fine and gives 100% accuracy.
   To run the program, simply execute the python script and a GUI window will open
